LIKES: I have the functionality working for users to like posts, I do not allow for users to unlike the posts they liked as to put more weight behind the likes. I also list each user who liked the post similar to the functionality on tumblr and pinterest. A user that has already liked the post cannot like the post again. 

DEPLOY: The script I wrote runs on the webserver, when you move the files over to the webserver and run the command at the root microblog directory it will set up the migrations and create a deployment of the website and automatically run it.

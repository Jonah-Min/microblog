A user can login using their email address, and once logged in they are sent to the list of posts. There they can create a blog post (the button is unavailable when you are not logged in). then when the blog is posted they can see the post right after submitting it. Then on the posts page, they can see there blog available. This is implemented in my app, and it also allows for logging out, where the create blog posts button will be unavailable. There is also a follow button on user pages only available if you are not that user, but it does not do anything sadly.
